    1.__________Qs: What is javascript?___________

     use it in backend(nodejs) and frontend(browser), Mobile(react 
     native), Desktop(electronJS).
    
     It is multi-paradigm programming language, Means we can use 
     it in different paradigms like functional programming (declarative, HOF, Pure function), 
     object-oriented programming (class, object, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation), 
     procedural programming (function, loop, conditional statement).




     2. __________Qs: What file extension is
      used for javascript?___________

     Ans: .js (javascript standard file extension)
     .jsx (javascript extension for react)
     .ts (typescript file extension)
     .tsx (typescript extension for react)


     3. __________Qs: What is the variable___________
        Ans: Variable is a container that holds a value.


     4. __________Qs: What is the difference 
     between var, let and const?___________

     Ans: var is function scoped, let and const are block scoped. 
     var is hoisted, let and const are not hoisted. var can be 
     redeclared, let and const cannot be redeclared. var & let can be reassigned but const cannot be reassigned.


     5. __________Qs: What is literal?___________

     Ans: Literal is a fixed value in code.
     Example:
      1, "hello"__ string literal, true, false__ boolean literal, null, undefined, [1,2,3]__ array literal, {name: "John", age: 20}__ object literal, () => {}, etc.



     6. __________Qs: What is the difference 
     between var, let and const?___________

     Ans: var is function scoped, let and const are block scoped. 
     var is hoisted, let and const are not hoisted. var can be 
     redeclared, let and const cannot be redeclared. var & let can be reassigned but const cannot be reassigned.

    
     7. __________Qs: What is camel case?___________

     Ans: Camel case is a naming convention for variables. 
     word is capitalized except the first word.


     
     8. __________Qs: What is Expression?___________

     Ans: Expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value.
     "It gives me something" is an expression.
        Whenever you see an expression, ask yourself: Does this give me something (a value)?
        If it does, it’s an expression.

        Example: 2 + 3 → gives you 5 → Expression
        Example: let x = 10 → you assign a value, but it doesn't give you a value directly → Not an expression (it's a statement).

        here let x = 10 is a statement, it doesn't give you a value directly.
        but x is an expression, it gives you a value 10.
        ____console.log(x) ___ 
        this whole above line is a statement but individually x is an expression as it evaluates to a value which is 10.

        Whenever you write a line of code, ask:
        "Is this line producing a value?"
        If it is (like a variable or operation), it's an expression.
        If it's doing something (like assigning or printing), it's a statement.
